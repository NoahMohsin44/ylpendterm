End of Term Creative Assignment
Bitesize Video Series
Submission Deadline: Sunday 4 th January 2026

Overview
This end-of-term assignment asks you to teach what you have learnt. You will
produce short, accessible video content introducing two core modules from this term
to someone encountering them for the first time.
This task develops your ability to:
 Structure knowledge clearly
 Communicate complex ideas simply
 Reflect on how your understanding has grown
 Translate learning into public-facing explanation
You will create two playlists, one for each module:
 Tafsīr of Sūrat al-Fātiḥa
 The Story of Palestine
Each playlist will consist of five videos, each approximately five minutes long.
Your imagined audience should be someone curious, intelligent, but new to the topic.

What You Are Expected to Produce
Core Format (Standard Option)
For each module:
 One playlist
 Five short videos
 Approximately five minutes per video
 Each video focuses on a single, clearly defined idea
 Videos connect together logically as a short introductory course
This means you will submit:
 Ten videos (five per module) in total
 Organised clearly by module and video number

Planning and Structuring Your Videos
1. Designing the Playlist Structure
Before recording anything, plan your playlists carefully.
Ask yourself:
 What would someone need to understand first?
 What ideas naturally build on one another?
 How can I move from basic orientation to deeper insight?
Example structure (illustrative only):
Tafsīr of Sūrat al-Fātiḥa
 Video 1: Why Sūrat al-Fātiḥa matters
 Video 2: God, reality, and worldview in al-Fātiḥa
 Video 3: Worship, mercy, and accountability
 Video 4: Guidance and the straight path
 Video 5: Al-Fātiḥa as a map for life
The Story of Palestine
 Video 1: Why Palestine matters and why it is contested
 Video 2: Ottoman Palestine and early modern changes
 Video 3: Colonialism, Zionism, and the British Mandate
 Video 4: 1948, displacement, and ongoing occupation
 Video 5: Palestine today and questions of justice, memory, and responsibility
You are not required to follow these examples exactly, but your structure should be
intentional and coherent.

2. Research and Content Development
You should draw upon:
 Module slides and handouts
 Assigned readings
 Credible online resources (lectures, articles, academic websites)

 Classical and contemporary scholarship where appropriate
Using AI Intelligently
AI tools may be used:
 To help outline video structures
 To summarise sources
 To generate draft explanations
 To help clarify your own thinking
However:
 AI should support, not replace, your reasoning
 You are responsible for accuracy and clarity
 Avoid generic or superficial explanations
Your goal is to produce content that could form the basis of a spoken transcript for
each video.

Writing and Practising Your Script
You are strongly encouraged to:
 Write a short transcript or detailed speaking notes for each video
 Use clear, natural language
 Avoid reading word-for-word on camera where possible
Before recording:
 Practise delivering the content aloud
 Time yourself to ensure you stay close to five minutes
 Adjust language so it sounds spoken, not written
Good delivery is:
 Calm and confident
 Clear and paced
 Engaged rather than rushed

Recording and Presentation Guidance

You do not need professional equipment. Simple and thoughtful setup matters more.
Key considerations:
 Record in a quiet space
 Ensure your face is well-lit (natural light is ideal)
 Position the camera at eye level
 Frame yourself clearly (head and shoulders works well)
 Speak clearly and audibly
You may:
 Speak directly to camera
 Use minimal notes off-screen
 Use simple visuals or slides if helpful (optional)
Focus on clarity, not perfection.

Alternative Formats (Permitted)
If the standard format does not suit you, the following alternatives are allowed:
1. Longer Lecture Format
 One or two longer videos per module
 Content equivalent to the five-video structure
 Still clearly segmented and well-organised
2. Podcast Style (Group Option)
 Small groups of 2 or 3 students
 Discussion-based format
 Clear structure and prepared themes
 Balanced contribution from each participant
3. Other Creative Formats
Other formats may be considered (for example, animated explanations or interview-
style discussions), but must be approved in advance.
If you have an alternative idea, email your proposal with:
 A short description of the format

 How it meets the learning aims of the assignment

What We Are Looking For
Your work will be assessed on:
 Clarity of explanation
 Quality of structure and progression
 Faithfulness to the material studied
 Ability to communicate to a non-specialist audience
 Thoughtfulness and effort
This is not about polished performance. It is about understanding, articulation, and
growth.

Final Advice
 Start early and plan carefully
 Think like a teacher, not an examiner
 Explain ideas as you would have liked them explained at the start of the term
 Focus on depth, not overload
 Use this as an opportunity to consolidate your learning
If you have questions at any point over the holidays, you are encouraged to get in
touch.
This assignment is not just an assessment. It is a step in learning how to
communicate knowledge meaningfully and responsibly.
